# The Obstacles and Resistance That Can Arise When Seeking to Use Brain Training for Focus

While brain training for focus can offer many benefits, it is not always easy to incorporate into daily life. There may be obstacles and resistance that arise when attempting to implement these practices.

In this chapter, we will explore the common obstacles and resistance that can arise when seeking to use brain training for focus, and strategies for navigating them.

One common obstacle is a lack of time. Many people feel overwhelmed with their responsibilities and find it difficult to carve out time for brain training exercises. To overcome this obstacle, individuals can start small by incorporating short sessions of meditation or deep breathing exercises into their daily routine. This can help to build momentum and create a habit of incorporating brain training into daily life.

Another obstacle can be a lack of motivation or discipline. It can be challenging to maintain focus and stick to a routine when facing distractions or competing priorities. To overcome this obstacle, individuals can set clear goals and incentives for themselves, such as rewarding themselves after completing a session of brain training exercises.

Resistance can also arise from external factors, such as societal or cultural norms that prioritize productivity over well-being. It can be challenging to prioritize self-care and mental health in a culture that values constant productivity. To overcome this resistance, individuals can reframe their mindset around productivity and success, prioritizing well-being and mental clarity as essential components of overall success.

Finally, resistance can come from within, in the form of self-doubt or negative self-talk. To overcome this obstacle, individuals can practice self-compassion and cultivate a growth mindset. They can remind themselves that progress takes time and effort and that setbacks are a natural part of the learning process.

By understanding the obstacles and resistance that can arise when seeking to use brain training for focus, readers will be better equipped to navigate these challenges and incorporate brain training into their daily lives. With dedication, persistence, and an open mind, readers can use the strategies and techniques in this book to train their brains for focus and achieve their full potential.
